**A TOOLBOX APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING THE RHODE ISLAND'S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS**

Across the United States, road infrastructure is failing. Within Rhode Island, billions of dollars 
have been spent planning, developing and maintaining critical transportation systems. Despite 
large investments, in recent years, Rhode Island has seen unprecedented failures within its transportation 
infrastructure, crippling local economies and threatening public safety's. This toolbox utilizes three 
critical tools aimed at optimizing hazard identification and urban planning. The buffer tool, for example, 
facilitates the creation of buffer zones around geographical elements, which could potentially serve as a 
visualizing feature capable of depicting areas of potential hazard or high risk of failure. On the other hand, 
the intersect tool enables the identification of spatial intersections between road segments and other features, 
offering insights into potential traffic conflict zones and facilitating route optimization studies. Similarly, 
the dissolve tool merges polygons that overlap or share a common boundary, enabling the consolidation of road 
segments belonging to the same category (e.g., areas prone to structural failure or zones affected by environmental 
hazards) into a single feature.
